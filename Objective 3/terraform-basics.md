## Objective 3: Understand Terraform basics

   - [HashiCorp Terraform Tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform?track=getting-started#getting-started)
   - This tutorial  goes through the process of installing Terraform and provider installation and versioning 
</p>

------------------------------

<details><summary>Providers</summary>


- The primary construct of the Terraform language are `resources`, the `behaviors` of resources rely on the resource `types`, resource types are defined by `providers`. 
- Providers have a set of resource types that defines which arguments are accepted, what attributes it exports, and how changes are applied to APIs. 
- Providers require their own configuration for regions, authentication etc. 
- **Configuration** 
  - providers are configured with a provider block: 
    ```BASH
        provider "google" { 
        project = "acme-app"
        region  = "us-central1"
        }

    #The google provider is assumed to be the provider for the resource type named google_compute_instance
    ```
  - configuration arguments like project and region are evaluated in order
  - 2 meta-arguments available for provider blocks: 
    - <code>version - to specify a version </code> and 
    - <code>alias - to use same provider with different config for different resources</code> 
  - provider blocks are not required if not explicitly configured Tf uses an empty default config when a resource from the provider is added
- **Initialization**
  - when a new provider is added to configuration Tf has to initialize the provider before it can be used
  - <code>terraform init</code> downloads and initializes any providers 
  - only installs to current working directory, other directories can have other versions installed
  
- **Versions**
  - versions should be configured in production to avoid breaking changes 
  - the <code>required_providers</code> block should be used in the Tf block:
    ```BASH
      terraform {
         required_providers {
         aws = "~> 1.0"
              }     
        }
    ```
  - When terraform init is re-run with providers already installed, it will use an already-installed provider that meets the constraints in preference to downloading a new version
  -  to upgrade all modules run <code>terraform init -upgrade</code>

- **Multiple Provider Instances** 
  - we can have multiple configs for the same provider by using the alias meta-argument to allow for multiple regions per provider, targeting multiple Docker hosts, etc.
     ```BASH
      # The default provider configuration
        provider "aws" {
         region = "us-east-1"
        }

      # Additional provider configuration for west coast region
        provider "aws" {
            alias  = "west"
            region = "us-west-2"
        }
    ```
- **Third Party Plugins** 
  - anyone can develop and distribute 3rd party Tf provers 
  - need to be manually downloaded because they are not supported by terraform init 
  - download must go in the user plugin directory - Windows: %APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins | Others: 	~/.terraform.d/plugins
- **Plugin Cache**
  - terraform init downloads plugins into a subdirectory of the working directory so each working dir is self contained. This means with more than one configuration with the same provider has a separate copy of the plugin for each config 
  - plugins can be large so this isn't performant  - Tf allows for a shared local directory for plugin cache. This has to be manually created in the CLI Configuration File.
       ```BASH
      # (Note that the CLI configuration file is _not_ the same as the .tf files
      #  used to configure infrastructure.)

        plugin_cache_dir = "$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"
       ```

<details><summary>Terraform Settings</summary>

- **Terraform Block Syntax**
  - only constant values can be used 
       ```BASH
        terraform {
        # ...
        }
       ```
- **Configuring a Terraform Backend**
  - this determines how state is stored, how operations are performed, remote back-ends for teams etc. 
    ```BASH
    terraform {
        backend "s3" {
        # (backend-specific settings...)
        }
    }
    ```
- **Specifying a Required Terraform Version**
- **Specifying Required Provider Versions**
- **Experimental Language Features**

<details><summary>Describe plug-in based architecture</summary>

- Terraform is build on plug-in based architecture. Providers and provisioners used in configuration are plugins (AWS, Heroku). Anyone can create a new plugin.

<details><summary>Describe how Terraform finds and fetches providers</summary>

- Resource types are defined by providers 
- Provider configuration is created with a provider block, the provider name is the name in the block header
- When a new provider is added Terraform has to initialize it before its used with the ```terraform init``` command. This downloads and installs the providers plugin


</details>

<details><summary>Explain when to use and not use provisioners and when to use local-exec or remote-exec</summary>

 -  Provisioners - provisioners are used to model specific actions on the local machine or on a remote machine to prepare infrastructure objects  
 - Provisioners are there if needed but they add complexity and uncertainty (should only be used as a last result)
 - Provisioners should be used if no other option will work.
 - Use cases:
   - Passing data into virtual machines and other compute resources 
   - running config management software 
 - local-exec - invokes a local executable after the resource is created. Invokes a process on the machine not on the resource. 
 - remote-exec - invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created.
