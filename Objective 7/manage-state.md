## Objective 7: Implement and maintain state	

<details><summary>Describe default local backend</summary>
<p>

- **Backends** - by default Terraform uses 'local' backend
  - This is an abstraction that determines how state is loaded and how an operation is executed. It allows such actions as non-local file state storage and remote execution 
  - Benefits:
    - Working in a team - can store state remotely and use locks to prevent corruption in state 
    - Keeping sensitive information off disk - state in backends are only stored in memory 
    - Remote operations - ```terraform apply``` can take time for larger infrastructures, some backends can use remote operations instead to execute commands remotely 
- Local example config:
  ```BASH
    terraform {
        backend "local" {
        path = "relative/path/to/terraform.tfstate"
      }
    }
  ```
</p>

<details><summary>Outline state locking	</summary>
<p>

State Locking
- if supported by your backend state can be locked so others cannot change it while another change is being made. 
- this is automatic for all operations that can write state 
- Backends types supporting locking:(standard)artifactory,azurerm,consul,cos,etcd,etcdv3,gcs,http,manta,oss,pg,s3,swift,terraform enterprise, and in enhanced backends there are remote operations as well (plan, apply, etc.)
- A lock can be forced open with ```force-unlock``` which requires a unique nonce lock ID

<details><summary>Handle backend authentication methods	</summary>
<p>

- Different backends have different configuration for authentication, authentication can be done different ways within a backend.
- Example with azurerm:
  ```BASH  
    #authenticating using the Azure CLI or a Service Principal:
    terraform {
    backend "azurerm" {
        resource_group_name  = "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup"
        storage_account_name = "abcd1234"
        container_name       = "tfstate"
         key                 = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
        }
    } 

    #----------------------------------
    #authenticating using Managed Service Identity (MSI):
     terraform {
        backend "azurerm" {
            storage_account_name = "abcd1234"
            container_name       = "tfstate"
            key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
            use_msi              = true
            subscription_id  = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            tenant_id        = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            }
    }
  ```

<details><summary>Describe remote state storage mechanisms and supported standard backends</summary>
<p>

**Remote State Storage**
- Uses Terraform Cloud as a backend, allows free remote state management 
- [Tutorial for Remote State Storage](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/remote)

**Standard backends** 
- artifactory,azurerm,consul,cos,etcd,etcdv3,gcs,http,manta,oss,pg,s3,swift,terraform enterprise
</p>

</details>

<details><summary>Describe effect of Terraform refresh on state	</summary>
<p>

- ```terraform refresh```
- reconciles the state Terraform knows about via the state file. 
- refresh does not modify the infrastructure, it does modify the state file. 
</p>

</details>

<details><summary>Describe backend block in configuration and best practices for partial configurations	</summary>
<p>

Backend Config 
- Backends are configured in the Terraform files.
- there can only be one backend 
- This is an example of a config for "consul":
```BASH
terraform {
  backend "consul" {
    address = "demo.consul.io"
    scheme  = "https"
    path    = "example_app/terraform_state"
  }
}
```

Partial Configuration 
- You can omit certain arguments from the backend configuration. 
- This is done to avoid storing access keys or private data in the main configuration 
- adding the omitted arguments must be done during the initialization process by doing the following:
  - Interactively  - If interact input is enabled it will ask you for the required values 
  - File - ```terraform init -backend-config=PATH``` that contains the variables 
  - Command-link key/value pairs - ```terraform init -backend-config="KEY=VALUE"``` **This isn't recommended for secret keys since CL flags can be stored in a history file. 
</p>

</details>

<details><summary>Understand secret management in state files</summary>
<p>

- state contains resource IDs and attributes, db data that may have passwords. 
- with remote state, state is only in memory when in use. This is more secure 
- also some backends can encrypt the state data at rest
- Terraform Cloud encrypts state at rest and protects it with TLS in transit.
- Terraform Cloud keeps track of user identity, and state changes.
