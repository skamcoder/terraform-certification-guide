## Objective 4: Use the Terraform CLI (outside of core workflow)

<details><summary>Given a scenario: choose when to use terraform fmt to format code</summary>
<p>

```BASH
terraform fmt
```
 - This command is used for rewriting Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style.
 - It applies the Terraform language style conventions along with other changes for readability.
 - This insures consistency 
 - There might be changes with Terraform versions so it is recommended to run this command on modules after an upgrade.  
</p>

</details>

<details><summary>Given a scenario: choose when to use terraform taint to taint Terraform resources</summary>
<p>

```BASH
terraform taint
```
- Marks a resource as tainted, forcing it to be destroyed and recreated on the next apply.
- It does not modify infrastructure but does modify the state file 
- After a resource is marked the next plan shows it will be destroyed and recreated on the next apply 
- Useful when we want a side effect of a recreation that is not visible in the attributes of the resource. For ex/rebooting the machine from a base image causing a new startup script to run.
- This command can affect resources that depend on the tainted resource. Ex/ DNS resource that uses IP of a server, that resource might need to be updated with the new IP of a tainted server. 
- Examples: 
  ```BASH
     #Tainting a Single Resource
     terraform taint aws_security_group.allow_all
  ```
  ```BASH
     #Tainting a single resource created with for_each
     terraform taint 'module.route_tables.azurerm_route_table.rt[\"DefaultSubnet\"]'
  ```
  ```BASH
     #Tainting a Resource within a Module
     terraform taint "module.couchbase.aws_instance.cb_node[9]"
  ```
</p>

</details>


<details><summary>Given a scenario: choose when to use terraform import to import existing infrastructure into our Terraform state	</summary>
<p>

```BASH
terraform import
```
- Imports existing resources into Terraform 
- Examples: 
  ```BASH
     #Import into Resource
     #import an AWS instance into the aws_instance resource named foo
     terraform import aws_instance.foo i-abcd1234
  ```
  ```BASH
     #Import into Module
     #import an AWS instance into the asw_instance resource named bar into module named foo: 
     terraform import module.foo.aws_instance.bar i-abcd1234
  ```
  ```BASH
     #Import into Resource configured with count
     #import an AWS instance into the first instance of the aws_instance resource named baz configured with count: 
     terraform import 'aws_instance.baz[0]' i-abcd1234
  ```
  ```BASH
     #Import into Resource configured with for_each
     #import an AWS instance into the example instance of the aws_instance resource named baz configured with for_each: 
     terraform import 'aws_instance.baz["example"]' i-abcd1234   #Linux, MacOs, Unix
     terraform import 'aws_instance.baz[\"example\"]' i-abcd1234 #PowerShell
     terraform import aws_instance.baz[\"example\"] i-abcd1234   #Windows 
  ```

</p>

</details>

<details><summary>Given a scenario: choose when to use terraform workspace to create workspaces</summary>
<p>

```BASH
terraform workspace
terraform workspace select
terraform workspace new
```
- Terraform configuration has a backend that defines operations and where persistent data is stored ([state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/purpose.html))
- Persistent data in the backend belongs to a workspace. 
- Creating different workspaces is useful to manage different stages of deployment (sandbox or production)
- At first the backend only has one workspace 'default'. This workspace cannot be deleted. 
- Certain backends can support multiple named workspaces. This allows multiple states to be associated with a single configuration. 
- Config still only has one backend with more than one instance of that config 
-  Backends that support multiple workspaces:
   -  AzureRM
   -  Consul
   -  COS
   -  GCS
   -  Local 
   -  Manta
   -  Postgres
   -  Remote 
   -  S3
- Examples: 
   ```BASH
     #Creating a workspace 
    terraform workspace new bar
    #Created and switched to workspace "bar"!

    #We're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
    #so if we run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
    #for this configuration.
  ``` 
</p>

</details>


<details><summary>Given a scenario: choose when to use terraform state to view Terraform state</summary>
<p>

```BASH
terraform state 
```
- Used for advanced state management 
- Used instead of changing state directly 
- this is a nested subcommand (has more subcommands) 
  - [Resource Addressing](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/addressing.html) 
  - [list](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/list.html)
  - [mv](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/mv.html)
  - [pull](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/pull.html)
  - [push](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/push.html) 
  - [rm](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/rm.html)
  - [show](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/show.html) 
</p>

</details>


<details><summary>Given a scenario: choose when to enable verbose logging and what the outcome/value is	</summary>
<p>

```BASH
TF_LOG 
#LOG LEVELS 
TRACE 
DEBUG 
INFO
WARN 
ERROR 
TF_LOG_PATH #Persist logged output 
```
- Trace is the most verbose and it is the default
- If Terraform crashes a Crash log is saved with the debug logs with panic message and backtrace 
</p>
